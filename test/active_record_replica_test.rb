# Unit Test for active_record_replica
#
# Since there is no database replication in this test environment, it will
# use 2 separate databases. Writes go to the first database and reads to the second.
# As a result any writes to the first database will not be visible when trying to read from
# the second test database.
#
# The tests verify that reads going to the replica database do not find data written to the primary.
